Most programming tools are readily available on Debian systems via the wonderful apt tool.
</p>
<p>
I've been interested in Ruby and Rails for a while but each time I try to dabble with a project I run into trouble ...

I just read this thread on the <a href="http://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/206110">Recommended way to install Rubygems</a> which gives me a much better understanding of both the technical and political problems behind this.
</p>
<p>
So if a ruby project I want to use is available via apt - then great. But if I want to hack on somethi8ng, or if it isn't available then I need to install the stack from source.
</p>
<p>
That's a shame - but at least if now know that's the deal I shouldn't end up running into so many dead ends.
</p>
<p>
And for when I've actually gotten something written in ruby I'll re-read <a href="http://pkg-ruby-extras.alioth.debian.org/rubygems.html">Debian/Ruby Extras - On RubyGems</a>
