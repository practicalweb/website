The music player banshee which is part of the default Ubuntu setup pops up a message each time a new track starts playing.

To turn this off

<ol>
<li>Open Banshee</li>
<li>Go to Edit, preferences, extensions</li>
<li>Enable Notification Area Icon</li>
<li>The Icon should now show up - right click on it</li>
<li>Uncheck Show notifications</li>
<li>Disable the Notification Area Icon again</li>
<ol>

Very annoying - the option to turn off notifications is hidden on a menu you can't get to by default.
