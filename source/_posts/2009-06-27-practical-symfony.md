Well having found the Definitive Guide to Symfony a bit uninspiring I've spent a bit of time on the &quot;Practical Symfony&quot; book - online.

<p>
So far it's great - the first &quot;three days&quot; lessons went by pretty quick, and I'm glad I'd done some background reading.
</p>
<p>
Putting the two things together I feel I've probably got enough understandingÂ  to start writing a basic app - which is exactly what I need to do to make sense of a load of reading.

<p>
Following a step by step guide is a great way top get started - but you never really understand something till you do it for real.
