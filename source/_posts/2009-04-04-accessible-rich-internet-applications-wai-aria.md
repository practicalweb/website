I've just been reading some good stuff on developing accessible web applications that still benefit from rich interactivity.

I've been keen on building accessible websites for a long time, and I find everyone benefits from this - well developed accessible sites are just easier for everyone to use.

What's great is that it can be as simple as just clearly defining the navigation areas of the site, or as complex as adding a semantic layer on top of a full application.
