OK - so I'm a heretic.
</p>
<p>
This is absolutely against the accepted Drupal Dogma.
</p>
<p>
What's great about Drupal is that you can achieve most things without hacking the core codebase; this means that every Drupal installation has the same base and any good developer who knows Drupal can take over the site.
</p>
<p>
But ....
</p>
<p>
There are things you cannot achieve by writing modules or theming. 
</p>
<p>
For example: Drupal has a &quot;database connection failure&quot; page which it displays if database fails, this page cannot be themed and shows the Drupal logo. If you want to show a custom page you have to hack core- modules and themes don't get loaded unless the databases says so.
</p>
<p>
Some suggest logging a support query - or supplying a patch for Drupal - but since feature requests are not accepted for released versions of Drupal this seems somewhat futile to me. <br />
This is especially the case if you have been using Drupal as a framework - the API is not backwards compatible so you cannot reasonably upgrade.Â  
</p>
<p>
The only downside to hacking core is that you have to maintain this change through Drupal upgrades.
</p>
<p>
My prefered way to upgrade Drupal is by keeping each release in subversion in a separate folder from my project, then I merge the changes between Drupal releases to my site. This is easy, keeps a good record of changes, and retains my hacks.
