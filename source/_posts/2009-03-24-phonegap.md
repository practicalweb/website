<p>
Phonegap is an open source compatibility layer for mobile development.
</p>
<p>
It provides access to common mobile functionality such as geolocation, sound, contacts etc via a JavaScript API
</p>
<p>
The idea is to make phone development more like web development, and to make deploying cross platform pas much easier.
</p>
<p>
This project looks to be in fairly early stages, but already very powerful.
