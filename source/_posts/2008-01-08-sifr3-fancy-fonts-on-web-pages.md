I’ve just been working on a site that uses <a href="http://wiki.novemberborn.net/sifr/What+is+sIFR">sIFR</a>
to incorporate a specific font into the design - this works very well
generally but we had a problem where links did not work on the MAC or
in IE6.<br />
<div class="post-entry">
<p>
<br />
This problem seems to have been solved in sIFR3 which also brings much
more flexibility - styles can change within the replaced text, filters
like drop shadow area available - and actions like mouseover can
trigger javascript callbacks.
</p>
<p>
The only thing I couldn’t see a way of doing was changing the background color of a link on hover…
