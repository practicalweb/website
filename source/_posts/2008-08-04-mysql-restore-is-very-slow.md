It seems there is a bug in MySQL which is causing restores to run very slowly (hours instead of minutes)
</p>

<p>
The bug is fixed in <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/releasenotes-cs-5-0-67.html">release 5.0.67</a>
</p>
<p>
But Ubuntu hasn't updated yet....
</p>
<p>
Fortunately this bug is specific to the command line client.Â 
</p>
<p>
Workaround: use the MySQL Administrator GUI instead.
