<p>
Drupal 6 has been out for a while now, Drupal 7 is in the works, and yet most sites still seem to be using Drupal 5. Is it time to upgrade yet?
</p>
<p>
If it was just the core features the answer would be simple, Drupal 6 is better and is fully stable.
</p>
<p>
The problem is that many (maybe most) of the features of a Drupal website are powered by contributed modules, and modules written for Drupal 5 don't work with Drupal 6.
</p>
<p>
This site uses 17 contributed modules; of these 9 have a clear upgrade path, 4 have new versions that are not yet stable, and 4 have no upgrade path.
</p>
<p>
I could write upgrades for the 4 problem modules (but I don't really have time). I could decide I don't need those features.
</p>
<p>
But Drupal 5 is still the only option if you want e-commerce, CiviCRM, and a whole host of other features.
</p>
<p>
I won't be upgrading for now - for me Drupal 5 still provides the most flexibility.
