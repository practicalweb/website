For several years I worked as a web developer for <a href="http://www.ramblers.org.uk/">the Ramblers</a> and this experience very much colours my view of <a href="http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/opendata">todays release</a> of free maps and postcode data.
</p>
<p>
This is a fantastic and significant step in the direction of ensuring that some of the worlds best mapping assets do the most good for society as a whole.
</p>
<p>
It will no doubt lead to an explosion of new applications and innovations.
</p>
<p>
Not least I expect we'll see much better maps being used everywhere that couldn't previously negotiate an OS license - not only were licenses expensive they were notoriously unclear.
</p>
<p>
However I can see why <a href="http://www.ramblers.org.uk/news/latest_news/OSfreemaps">the Ramblers are unhappy</a> at todays release   
</p>
<p>
If I want to show a map of a walk in the Lake district 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
That's the Lakes...

</p>
<p>
Near Ulswater...

</p>
<p>
It was from Glenridding up towards Helvelyn...

</p>
<p>
...Er.. yeah that's the place - but where's the path! 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
So this is a brilliant release and even for the Ramblers there's loads of stuff they can do today that they either couldn't do yesterday or it would have been more expensive and complex. 
</p>
<p>
And loads of smaller organisations will benefit from free maps and postcode data - these will become common on small websites.
</p>
<p>
But the release doesn't quite give out the assets required to build the apps I always wanted to build for the Ramblers (walking routes, enhanced walks finder, path problem report tools etc).
