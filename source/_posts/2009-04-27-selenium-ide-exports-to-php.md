Oh cool :-)
</p>
<p>
I just noticed that selenium IDE has the option to export tests as PHP unit tests.
</p>
<p>
This is great - the IDE is a good way to interactively build up tests by recording a set of actions and tweaking what it records. 
</p>
<p>
And being able to save them as unit tests makes it easy to integrate this with automated testing.
</p>
<p>
Interestingly they are created as PHPunit tests - not simpletest tests.
</p>
<p>
It does look like I'm being pushed more towards PHPunit - though I wonder how I'll integrate this with Drupal development and it's focus on simpletest.
