When developing a website it's important to test it in as many different web browsers as possible. 
</p>
<p>
If a client has a problem viewing the page there's little point saying &quot;but it works on my machine&quot;
</p>
<p>
 
I have found that the differences between different versions of firefox to be small enough that testing in one version is sufficient.
</p>
<p>
Internet Explorer is so different between versions that each target version must be tested seperately.
</p>
<p>
There is a <a href="http://tredosoft.com/Multiple_IE">package for multiple IEs</a>.
</p>
<p>
But you can't then install the developer toolbar, and I'm not quite convinced that install is 100% the same as having a standard browser.
</p>
<p>
Fortunately Microsoft are aware of the problem and make a test virtual machine available.
</p>
<p>
I've used this for a while for testing IE6 - and it works very well.
They have now released a verion of IE8 - time to check that my websites won't break when users start updating.
