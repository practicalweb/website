I was just reading this presentation on deploying Drupal 
</p>
<p>
http://www.slideshare.net/eaton/drupal-deployment-presentation
</p>
<p>
and noticed 
</p>
<p>
http://drupal.org/project/install_profile_api
</p>
<p>
Which seems to have a collection of API functions needed at install/upgrade time that are missing from Drupal (and contrib modules)
</p>
<p>
And even better this is great motivation to write more such functions myself instead of just using SQL hacks.
