There are times you really really want to be sure your code doesn't have any bugs at all.

This is one of those times.

<object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/yln_IGDuOCo&hl=en&fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/yln_IGDuOCo&hl=en&fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object>

I really hope they had a good set of tests running on thier software before doing that!
