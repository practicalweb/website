CSS revolutionised web development, &lt;font&gt; and &lt;table&gt; were a nightmare in comparison.
</p>
<p>
But still there are times when CSS feels very limited, if you want to change a colour or margin size and have to hunt through the CSS to calculate the related changes.
</p>
<p>
But now there is 
</p>
<p>
http://lesscss.org/
</p>
<p>
Which looks like it fills in some of the missing gaps - it extends the CSS syntax and to it's own format - and then generates standard CSS from this.
</p>
<p>
I'm definitely planning on using this for my next project.Â
