<a href="http://www.docbook.org/tdg5/en/html/docbook.html">Docbook</a> is a great standard for technical documentation, it is easily converted into a range of formats (html, pdf etc) and while it can be styled according to taste; the layout is always familiar.
</p>
<p>
When I first started using Linux you had to read a lot of documentation - and it was mostly in docbook format so I got kind of used to it.
</p>
<p>
But it's a rich standard - making it much harder to learn than HTML.
</p>
<p>
And there don't seem to be many good editors for it.
</p>
<dl>
<dt>OpenOffice</dt>
<dd>Templates available and can save as docbook - but for me it doesn't produce valid documents</dd>
<dt>Lyx</dt>
<dd>This only ever supported a subset of the docbook standard, and whil it is quite nice to use docbook support seems to have faltered: it doesn't work for me.</dd>
<dt>Quanta</dt>
<dd>The KDE web editor, provides some supportive utilities but is basically a syntax highlighted text editor in this role.</dd>
</dl>
<p>
and there are others...
</p>

</p>
<p>
But nothing that really grabbed me...
</p>
<p>
until I found
</p>
<p>
http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/os-eclipse-docbook/index.html
</p>
<p>
I can use Eclipse to create the docs <img src="/sites/default/modules/tinymce/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/images/smiley-cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool" />
</p>
<p>
It's not a WYSIWIG editor, but it does know which elements can go where 
</p>
<p>
<img src="/sites/default/files/u1/eclipse-docbook-gui.png" width="267" height="263" /> 
</p>
<p>
Which softens the learning curve a lot.
</p>
<p>
and it does validate the document for you 
</p>
<p>
<img src="/sites/default/files/u1/eclipse-docbook-validation.png" width="252" height="154" />
</p>
<p>
Meaning that when I create the output - it just works!
</p>
<p>
I'll post more when I've written some actual documentation.
