I seem to be progressivly going Google, it started with search but for a long time I resisted the lure of Googles other treats.
</p>
<p>
However since I got an Android phone I've been getting slowly sucked in with accounts on Gmail, Picassa, Google, Calender, and now Google Apps 
</p>
<p>
One thing I found out is that you <a href="http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Google+Apps/thread?tid=5e6502d85823b15f&amp;hl=en&amp;fid=5e6502d85823b15f000479078747d294">can't upgrade from a Gmail account to a Google Apps one</a> what you have to do is create a new account and do a lot of exporting/importing.
</p>
<p>
A Google apps account allows you to use your own domain name for email, and manage all accounts at that domain but is otherwise not so different to a Gmail account.
</p>
<p>
The lack of upgrade path is a pain but the actual account creation and migration process was easy; I had my email going to the new account within half an hour.
</p>
<p>
The next snag was updating my Android phone to use the new account; there is no obvious way to do this but a bit of googling gave me the answer:
</p>
<p>
Go to Setting &gt; Application &gt; Manage Application 
</p>
<p>
Then for each of 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Gmail</li>
	<li>Gmail storage</li>
	<li>Google apps</li>
	<li>Google search</li>
</ul>
<p>
&quot;clear data&quot;
</p>
<p>
You should shortly be prompted to enter your new account details.
</p>
<p>
Make sure you have imported your contacts and calender to the new account before doing this so that your cleared data gets restored quickly.
