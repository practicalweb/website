I've been looking into git for a while, the core toolset has been mature for ages but it just didn't seem to have the wider support I wanted.
</p>
<p>
Now I look again and the egit plugin for eclipse has improved massively with full eclipse integration http://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/User_Guide
</p>
<p>
There is a git plugin for trac http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/GitPlugin
</p>
<p>
It looks like it's time for me to dive into git properly :-)
