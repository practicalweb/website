<p>
Having just upgraded to Ubuntu 8.10 my key observation is that it's important to read the release notes first.
</p>

</p>
<p>
There are a few bugs which have affected me
</p>
<ul>
	<li>there is no bluetooth support in KDE</li>
	<li>my wifi card only works in the US<br />
	(there's a workaround and I'm back online)</li>
	<li>Â Dual head display with xrandr is causing problems<br />
	(my screen flashes and KDE is putting widgets in parts of the screen I can't see)</li>
	<li>Subversion has moved to version 1.5 and getting Eclipse to use a compatible svn library is proving tricky</li>
</ul>
<p>
On the plus side KDE 4.1 is looking very pretty, and the move to subversion 1.5 will be very useful in the long run.
</p>
<p>
I had hoped to get my 3G connection working as a previous update seems to have broken it - but so far still no joy.
