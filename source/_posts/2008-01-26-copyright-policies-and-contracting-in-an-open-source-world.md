really interesting thread on the Drupal consultants mailing list
<div class="post-entry">
<p>
especially of note:

	<p>
	We work primarily with educational entities and non-profits; in our line<br />
	of work the fear of competition comes up infrequently, but it still<br />
	comes up –
	</p>
	<p>
	WRT Alan’s question re posting our dev agreement — we spent a fair<br />
	amount of time and money working through this with our lawyers — the<br />
	resulting document is tied pretty closely to our business model and our<br />
	work with educators and non-profits.
	</p>
	<p>
	At the core, though, the section in question — and this is the section<br />
	that has been very useful to us — makes the following distinctions —<br />
	and IANAL so these distinctions are a layperson’s distinctions, and<br />
	should not be confused with the writings of a person who actually knows<br />
	anything about the topic :-) 
	</p>
	<p>
	Client pre-existing IP: specialized information/knowledge that the<br />
	client has developed<br />
	Developer pre-existing IP: specialized information/knowledge that we<br />
	have developed<br />
	Project IP: work that results from Client and Developer coming together<br />
	to solve the client’s specific needs. For us, this is often a blurry<br />
	line, as we are frequently approached by clients to help them<br />
	articulate, and then solve, the specific issues within their organization.<br />
	Custom Code: Any code we write belongs to the client as work for hire<br />
	License Back: the client agrees to grant us a perpetual, royalty free<br />
	license, as governed by a non-compete clause (ie, we don’t copy the<br />
	client’s business plan — for us, this isn’t generally an issue, as we<br />
	work with non-profits and schools)<br />
	GPL: Custom code is licensed under the GPL, and will be released back to<br />
	the community under terms negotiated b/w Client and Developer
	</p>
	<p>
	The key elements are the different types of IP, and how the code is<br />
	owned and licensed. By clearly stating that we develop GPL code, we have<br />
	the conversation up front, which allows us to avoid any<br />
	misunderstandings re licensing.
	</p>
	<p>
	The one exception we make is themes/graphic identity. The branding<br />
	always remains the property of the client.<br />
	&gt;<br />
	&gt;&gt;<br />
	&gt;&gt;     I was a consultant for over 4 years and never under any<br />
	&gt;&gt;     circumstances would we be allowed to reuse a solution built for<br />
	&gt;&gt;     one client for another client.  We were expensive, however, the<br />
	&gt;&gt;     client kept everything always.<br />
	&gt;<br />
	This is possible in theory, but, IMO, more difficult in practice — once<br />
	you know how to do something, you can’t un-know it. As a recent example,<br />
	we worked out some publishing workflows on a community writing site we<br />
	developed this summer. The process was unique to the client, as it met<br />
	their specific internal needs. On a site we brought live this fall, we<br />
	used some of the same principles to support an online grant application<br />
	and review process. To somebody looking strictly at the technical<br />
	solution, it would look amazingly similar, despite the complete<br />
	differences in context. Part of the reason we have the license-back<br />
	clause in our contract is to protect us against any misunderstanding<br />
	here — the fact that we have experience is a good thing. Again, I think<br />
	I’m missing something wrt the original comment.
	</p>
	<p>
	Cheers,
	</p>
