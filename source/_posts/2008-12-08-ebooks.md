I have far too many books, both technical and diversionary, I read a great deal online, and still find myself printing a lot out: so I've been interested in the new generation of ereaders.
</p>
<p>
The devices seem pretty good, certainly the text is very clear, capacity and battery life are reportedly great.
</p>
<p>
I've tried out the open source project <a href="http://calibre.kovidgoyal.net/">caliber</a> which can convert various formats into ebook format.
</p>
<p>
But it seems these books only really display text well, I wasn't at all happy with the results of converting from A4 PDF documents (from O'Reilly books) the resulting pages were terribly laid out.
</p>
<p>
I'm also very suprised to find books to be more expensive electronically.

</p>
<p>
The e-ink technology looks great - I look forward to larger devices with better ability to display tables and fonts.
</p>
<p>
In the meantime I'm sticking with books, printouts, and my laptop.
