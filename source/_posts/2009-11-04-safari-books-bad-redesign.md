<p>
I've had an account with O'Reilly's <a href="http://my.safaribooksonline.com/">Safari books</a> on and off for years
</p>
<p>
I've cancelled it before beacuase of design issues that rendered it unworkable for me.
</p>
<p>
This time they have &quot;upgraded&quot; the site from an AJAX based layout which allowed me to choose between &quot;print fidelity&quot; and &quot;HTML view&quot;.
</p>
<p>
The new layout uses Flash to render the pages as they look in print in a scrollable window.
</p>
<p>
I hate this because
</p>
<ul>
	<li>I work on a widescreen laptop with development toolbars and tabs in my browser - this layout of a tall thin view just doesn't fit on my screen.</li>
	<li>I can't scroll the Safari menu and banner offscreen </li>
	<li>Most of the time I don't care too much about formatting I just want to read it and HTML is easier to read</li>
	<li>The scrolling doesn't respond to my mousewheel</li>
	<li>I like to get a nice big page of text onscreen and the use the browsers search to quickly home in on the bit I want to read. </li>
</ul>
Oh well - back to books for now and another incentive to try and get the perfect ereader...
