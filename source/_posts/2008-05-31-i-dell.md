I bought a Dell laptop with pre-installed Linux and it's been just great - all the hardware just works (better than a similar laptop with Windows)

One of the great benefits of Linux is that you get far more frequent upgrades than with other systems, as a developer it pays to keep ahaed of the curve.

The downside of this can be problems with those upgrades. But I've just found that Dell have a site telling me how to fix the few problems I've come accross with my current upgrade.
